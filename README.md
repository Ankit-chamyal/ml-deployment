🫀 Coronary Artery Disease Prediction System
A machine learning-based web application for predicting the risk level (Low, Medium, High) of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) using medical input parameters. Built using Python, Flask, and multiple ML models.

🔍 Project Overview
Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection and intervention can help reduce complications. This project leverages machine learning to predict CAD risk and provides users with insights, visual feedback, and preventive suggestions.

📊 Features
🧠 Predicts CAD risk using trained models: Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression
📈 Visual representation of results (risk bar chart)
👤 Simple and intuitive user interface
💡 Provides basic health suggestions based on risk level
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
Flask (Web Framework)
HTML, CSS (Frontend templates)
